# shoebox
A simple script for storing information and testing yourself according to the idea of "spaced repetition"
The idea for this way of learning is based on the concept of "spaced repetition".
It is beautifully explained here: https://ncase.me/remember/
I never wanted to sit down with a physicall shoebox also because I travel a lot and I hated calculating what "levels"
need to be tested today. Therefore I implemented this as a Python script. The basic functions work but it is not perfect yet.

shoebox.py reads and writes into "shoebox.csv" which consists of three columns, "clue" (the clue you will get),
"target" (what you have to enter / you want to learn) and "level" (the level of your proficiency, starting at 1)
I use the .bat file to execute it.
Feel free to use it as you please! CC0
